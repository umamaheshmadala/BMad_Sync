# Story 1.1: Platform Setup & Core Repository Initialization

**Status:** Done

## Story Statement
As a developer,
I want the core project repository and environment configured,
so that other development tasks can begin on a standardized foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Project repository initialized with a main branch.
- Basic monorepo structure set up (`apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/shared`).
- Frontend (React/Vite) project bootstrapped within `apps/web`.
- Backend (Supabase Edge Functions/Netlify) project structure initialized within `apps/api`.
- Shared TypeScript types package created within `packages/shared`.
- Basic `package.json` configurations for root and sub-projects are set up.
- Git ignored files configured.
- Initial `README.md` created with basic setup instructions.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist. This is the foundational setup.

### Data Models
No specific data models required for initial setup. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### API Specifications
No API endpoints required for initial setup. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Component Specifications
No UI components required for initial setup. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### File Locations
- Monorepo root: project root
- Frontend: `apps/web/`
- Backend: `apps/api/`
- Shared types: `packages/shared-types/`
- (Optional) UI components: `packages/ui-components/`
- Shared config: `packages/config/`
- Documentation: `docs/`

### Testing Requirements
- Set up test scaffolding for Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright/Cypress in appropriate locations.
- Ensure test scripts are present in `package.json` files. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Use TypeScript for all codebases.
- Follow coding standards for type sharing, API service layer, env var access, error handling, and naming conventions. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use Vite for frontend, Supabase/Netlify for backend, Tailwind CSS for styling. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
gemini-2.5-flash

### Debug Log References
- Initial `mkdir` command issues.
- PowerShell `&&` operator issues.
- Incorrect directory creation due to CWD.
- `.gitignore` file creation/overwrite issues.

### Completion Notes List
- Successfully initialized git repository with main branch.
- Created monorepo structure with `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/shared-types`, and `docs`.
- Bootstrapped React/Vite project in `apps/web` and installed dependencies.
- Initialized backend project structure in `apps/api` with `src` directory and `netlify.toml`.
- Created `packages/shared-types` with `src`, `tsconfig.json`, and `package.json`.
- Configured root `package.json` with workspaces.
- Added `.gitignore` files for root, `apps/web`, `apps/api`, and `packages/shared-types`.
- Created initial `README.md`.
- Set up test scaffolding: Jest and React Testing Library for `apps/web`, and Playwright for e2e tests at the root.
