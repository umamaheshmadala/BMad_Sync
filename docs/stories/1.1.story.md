# Story 1.1: Platform Setup & Core Repository Initialization

**Status:** Draft

## Story Statement
As a developer,
I want the core project repository and environment configured,
so that other development tasks can begin on a standardized foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Project repository initialized with a main branch.
- Basic monorepo structure set up (`apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/shared`).
- Frontend (React/Vite) project bootstrapped within `apps/web`.
- Backend (Supabase Edge Functions/Netlify) project structure initialized within `apps/api`.
- Shared TypeScript types package created within `packages/shared`.
- Basic `package.json` configurations for root and sub-projects are set up.
- Git ignored files configured.
- Initial `README.md` created with basic setup instructions.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist. This is the foundational setup.

### Data Models
No specific data models required for initial setup. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### API Specifications
No API endpoints required for initial setup. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Component Specifications
No UI components required for initial setup. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### File Locations
- Monorepo root: project root
- Frontend: `apps/web/`
- Backend: `apps/api/`
- Shared types: `packages/shared-types/`
- (Optional) UI components: `packages/ui-components/`
- Shared config: `packages/config/`
- Documentation: `docs/`

### Testing Requirements
- Set up test scaffolding for Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright/Cypress in appropriate locations.
- Ensure test scripts are present in `package.json` files. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Use TypeScript for all codebases.
- Follow coding standards for type sharing, API service layer, env var access, error handling, and naming conventions. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use Vite for frontend, Supabase/Netlify for backend, Tailwind CSS for styling. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. Initialize git repository with main branch. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
2. Create monorepo folder structure: `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/shared-types`, `docs`, etc. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
3. Bootstrap React/Vite project in `apps/web`. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
4. Initialize backend project structure for Supabase Edge Functions/Netlify in `apps/api`. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
5. Create `packages/shared-types` with initial TypeScript config. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
6. Set up root and sub-project `package.json` files with workspaces. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
7. Add `.gitignore` files for root and sub-projects. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
8. Create initial `README.md` with setup instructions. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
9. Set up test scaffolding for Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright/Cypress. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
10. Verify all folder/file names and locations match the unified project structure. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
