# Story 2.2: Business Storefront Product Display

**Status:** Draft

## Story Statement
As a business owner,
I want to display my top/new/trending/customer favorite products on my storefront,
so that users can get a brief idea of what to expect.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Business owner can manually select and arrange between 4 and 10 products for display on their storefront.
- Business owner can change their displayed products anytime.
- Each displayed product can have a name, description, and image.
- The system provides suggestions for trending products (e.g., based on product searches, category searches, coupon categories, user interests, products in user wish lists) to the business owner.
- Products are displayed on the business's storefront page.
- StorefrontProducts table is populated with storefront_id, product_name, product_description, product_image_url, display_order, and is_trending flag for suggested items.
- Local Testability: API endpoint POST /api/storefronts/{storefront_id}/products adds products, returning 200 OK. Verification by querying SELECT * FROM public.StorefrontProducts WHERE storefront_id = '{storefront_id}'.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Storefront management and branding are in place. [Source: docs/stories/2.1.story.md]

### Data Models
- StorefrontProducts table: storefront_id, product_name, product_description, product_image_url, display_order, is_trending. [Source: PRD]
- Product selection and arrangement logic. [Source: PRD]

### API Specifications
- POST /api/storefronts/{storefront_id}/products: Adds/updates displayed products. [Source: PRD]
- GET /api/storefronts/{storefront_id}/products: Retrieves displayed products. [Source: PRD]
- All API interactions must go through frontend API service layer (`apps/web/src/api/`). [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Component Specifications
- Product selection/arrangement interface for business owners. [Source: PRD]
- Product display component on storefront page. [Source: PRD]
- Trending product suggestions UI. [Source: PRD]

### File Locations
- Frontend pages: `apps/web/src/pages/business-storefront-products.tsx`
- API service: `apps/web/src/api/storefront-products.ts`
- Backend: `apps/api/src/storefronts/` (serverless functions for product display)
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Frontend: Unit and integration tests for product selection/arrangement and display. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Backend: Unit and integration tests for storefront product endpoints. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- E2E: Playwright/Cypress tests for product display and arrangement. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Use Supabase Storage for product images. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- TypeScript for all codebases. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Follow coding standards for API service layer, error handling, and naming conventions. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- State management for storefront products via React Context API/Zustand/Jotai. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
