# Story 1.2: User Authentication Core Flows

**Status:** Draft

## Story Statement
As a new user,
I want to sign up and log in securely,
so that I can access the SynC platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
- User registration page implemented with email/password fields.
- User login page implemented with email/password fields.
- Supabase Auth integrated for user signup and login.
- Basic routing for authenticated/unauthenticated states implemented.
- Error handling displayed for invalid credentials or registration failures.
- User session is securely managed upon login.
- Local Testability: API endpoint POST /api/auth/signup returns 200 OK with user session data upon valid payload (e.g., {"email": "test@example.com", "password": "securepassword"}).
- Local Testability: API endpoint POST /api/auth/login returns 200 OK with user session data upon valid payload.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Monorepo and core structure are in place. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md]

### Data Models
- User model: At minimum, email and password fields for authentication. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- User session data structure as returned by Supabase Auth. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### API Specifications
- POST /api/auth/signup: Accepts email and password, returns user session data. [Source: PRD]
- POST /api/auth/login: Accepts email and password, returns user session data. [Source: PRD]
- All API interactions must go through frontend API service layer (`apps/web/src/api/`). [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Component Specifications
- Registration page: Form with email/password fields, submit button, error display. [Source: PRD]
- Login page: Form with email/password fields, submit button, error display. [Source: PRD]
- Routing: Authenticated vs unauthenticated state handling. [Source: PRD]

### File Locations
- Frontend pages: `apps/web/src/pages/signup.tsx`, `apps/web/src/pages/login.tsx`
- API service: `apps/web/src/api/auth.ts`
- Backend: `apps/api/src/auth/` (serverless functions for auth)
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Frontend: Unit and integration tests for registration and login forms. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Backend: Unit and integration tests for auth endpoints. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- E2E: Playwright/Cypress tests for signup/login flow. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Use Supabase Auth for authentication. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- TypeScript for all codebases. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Follow coding standards for API service layer, error handling, and naming conventions. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- State management for user session via React Context API/Zustand/Jotai. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. Create registration and login pages with email/password forms. [Source: PRD]
2. Implement frontend API service for auth (signup/login). [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
3. Integrate Supabase Auth for user signup and login. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
4. Implement routing for authenticated/unauthenticated states. [Source: PRD]
5. Add error handling for invalid credentials/registration failures. [Source: PRD]
6. Manage user session securely upon login. [Source: PRD]
7. Write unit/integration tests for frontend forms and API service. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
8. Write unit/integration tests for backend auth endpoints. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
9. Write E2E tests for signup/login flow. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
10. Verify all file locations and naming conventions match unified project structure. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

## Project Structure Notes
- All files should be placed according to the unified project structure. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- No conflicts found between epic requirements and unified project structure.
