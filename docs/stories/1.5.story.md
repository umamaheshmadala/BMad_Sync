# Story 1.5: Business Profile Creation & Basic Management

**Status:** Approved

## Story Statement
As a new business owner,
I want to create and manage my basic business profile,
so that my business presence is established on the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Business profile creation form allows input for business name, address, Google location URL, contact info, open/close times, holidays and logo upload.
- Supabase Storage integrated for logo upload/storage.
- Business profile data is stored and retrieved from Supabase database.
- Basic business profile viewing page is accessible to the logged-in business owner.
- Businesses table in Supabase stores business_id, email, business_name, address, google_location_url, contact_info, logo_url, and created_at.
- Local Testability: Developer can verify the new business entry in the Businesses table by performing a direct SQL query (e.g., SELECT business_name, address FROM public.Businesses WHERE business_id = '[newly_created_business_id]').

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Business authentication and session management are in place. [Source: docs/stories/1.4.story.md]

### Data Models
- Businesses table: business_id, email, business_name, address, google_location_url, contact_info, logo_url, created_at. [Source: PRD]
- Profile form fields: business name, address, Google location URL, contact info, open/close times, holidays, logo. [Source: PRD]

### API Specifications
- API endpoints for business profile creation, update, and retrieval (e.g., /api/business/profile). [Source: PRD]
- All API interactions must go through frontend API service layer (`apps/web/src/api/`). [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Component Specifications
- Business profile creation form: Input fields for all required business info and logo upload. [Source: PRD]
- Business profile viewing page: Displays business profile info and logo. [Source: PRD]
- Logo upload: Integrate with Supabase Storage. [Source: PRD]

### File Locations
- Frontend pages: `apps/web/src/pages/business-profile.tsx`, `apps/web/src/pages/edit-business-profile.tsx`
- API service: `apps/web/src/api/business.ts`
- Backend: `apps/api/src/business/` (serverless functions for business profile)
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Frontend: Unit and integration tests for business profile form and viewing page. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Backend: Unit and integration tests for business profile endpoints. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- E2E: Playwright/Cypress tests for business profile creation and viewing. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Use Supabase Storage for logo upload. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- TypeScript for all codebases. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Follow coding standards for API service layer, error handling, and naming conventions. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- State management for business profile via React Context API/Zustand/Jotai. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
