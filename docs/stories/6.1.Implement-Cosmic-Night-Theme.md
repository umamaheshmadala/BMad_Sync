Status: Approved

Story:
  **As a** user,
  **I want** the application to display the "Cosmic Night" theme,
  **so that** I have a modern and aesthetically pleasing visual experience.

Acceptance Criteria:
  Functional Requirements:
  1. The application correctly displays the "Cosmic Night" theme colors, typography, and shadows in both light and dark modes.
  2. All `shadcn/ui` components adopt the "Cosmic Night" theme consistently.
  3. The theme integration leverages CSS variables defined in a global CSS file and configured via `tailwind.config.ts`.

  Integration Requirements: 4. Existing UI functionality continues to work unchanged. 5. New functionality follows `shadcn/ui` theming patterns. 6. Integration with the existing styling system maintains current behavior for non-themed elements.

  Quality Requirements: 7. The theme implementation is covered by appropriate visual regression tests. 8. Frontend architecture documents are updated to reflect the new theme. 9. No visual regression in existing functionality is verified.

Tasks / Subtasks:
  - [ ] Update global CSS file (e.g., `apps/web/src/index.css`) with "Cosmic Night" CSS variables.
  - [ ] Modify `apps/web/tailwind.config.ts` to integrate and extend the "Cosmic Night" theme.
  - [ ] Verify `shadcn/ui` components correctly apply the new theme.
  - [ ] Conduct visual regression testing across key application pages.
  - [ ] Update relevant UI components if they hardcode styles that conflict with the new theme.

Dev Notes:
  Integration Approach: Modify `apps/web/src/index.css` to include the "Cosmic Night" CSS variables and update `apps/web/tailwind.config.ts` to extend the theme.
  Existing Pattern Reference: Refer to shadcn/ui documentation on theming and custom CSS variables.
  Key Constraints: Ensure backward compatibility with existing components not yet migrated to shadcn/ui. Maintain accessibility standards for color contrast.

Testing:
  List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:
  - Test file location: Frontend component tests should be co-located with components.
  - Test standards: Utilize visual regression testing tools to detect unintended style changes.
  - Testing frameworks and patterns to use: React Testing Library for component rendering, Jest for unit tests, Cypress/Playwright for E2E visual regression.
  - Any specific testing requirements for this story: Dedicated visual regression test suite for theme verification.
