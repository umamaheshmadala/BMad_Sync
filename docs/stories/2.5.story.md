# Story 2.5: User Favoriting Businesses & Coupons

**Status:** Done

## Story Statement
As a user,
I want to favorite businesses and coupons,
so that I can easily access them and receive instant updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- User can add/remove businesses to/from their favorites list from a business storefront.
- User can add/remove coupons to/from their favorites list from the coupon discovery view or coupon wallet.
- Favorited businesses are accessible via a dedicated section/filter on the user dashboard.
- Favorited coupons are accessible and clearly marked within the coupon wallet.
- BusinessFollows table tracks user_id, business_id, receive_notifications (default TRUE).
- UserCoupons table is_favorite flag is updated.
- Local Testability: API endpoint POST /api/users/{user_id}/favorites/business adds a business to favorites. Verification by querying SELECT * FROM public.BusinessFollows WHERE user_id = '{user_id}' AND business_id = '{business_id}'.
