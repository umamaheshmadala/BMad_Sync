# Story 2.4: User Dashboard Display & Basic Personalization

**Status:** Draft

## Story Statement
As a user,
I want to see a personalized dashboard,
so that I can quickly view hot offers, trending content, and relevant ads.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The user dashboard page is rendered with a prominent navigation, search function, current city selection, user avatar, and profile dropdown.
- The dashboard dynamically displays "hot coupon offers" and "trending offers".
- The dashboard displays promotional ads from businesses, targeted based on the user's selected interests and current city.
- User can switch between cities to view content relevant to that city.
- User can set preferences for the frequency and type of promotional ads (e.g., only "hot offers," exclude certain categories).
- Users table privacy_settings JSONB field stores user preferences for ad frequency/type.
- Local Testability: API endpoint GET /api/users/{user_id}/dashboard returns dashboard data including personalized offers and ads. Verification via curl or Postman with different user_id and privacy_settings.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- User city and interest selection is in place. [Source: docs/stories/2.3.story.md]

### Data Models
- Users table: privacy_settings JSONB field for ad preferences. [Source: PRD]
- Dashboard data: hot offers, trending offers, ads, city, user info. [Source: PRD]

### API Specifications
- GET /api/users/{user_id}/dashboard: Returns dashboard data (offers, ads, user info, city, preferences). [Source: PRD]
- PUT /api/users/{user_id}/preferences: Updates ad frequency/type preferences. [Source: PRD]
- All API interactions must go through frontend API service layer (`apps/web/src/api/`). [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Component Specifications
- Dashboard page: Navigation, search, city selection, avatar, profile dropdown, hot/trending offers, ads. [Source: PRD]
- Preferences UI: Controls for ad frequency/type. [Source: PRD]

### File Locations
- Frontend pages: `apps/web/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`, `apps/web/src/pages/preferences.tsx`
- API service: `apps/web/src/api/dashboard.ts`, `apps/web/src/api/preferences.ts`
- Backend: `apps/api/src/users/` (serverless functions for dashboard and preferences)
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Frontend: Unit and integration tests for dashboard and preferences UI. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Backend: Unit and integration tests for dashboard and preferences endpoints. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- E2E: Playwright/Cypress tests for dashboard personalization and ad preferences. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript for all codebases. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Follow coding standards for API service layer, error handling, and naming conventions. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- State management for dashboard/preferences via React Context API/Zustand/Jotai. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
