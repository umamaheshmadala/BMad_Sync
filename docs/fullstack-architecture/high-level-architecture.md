# High Level Architecture
Technical Summary
SynC will be built as a serverless-first fullstack application, deployed on Netlify, with a React/Vite frontend and a Supabase-powered backend (PostgreSQL, Auth, Edge Functions). The architecture will follow a monorepo structure to manage shared code and streamline development. This design prioritizes scalability, real-time capabilities, and cost-effectiveness to support 10,000+ concurrent users and achieve the PRD's goals of enhancing Hyperlocal business engagement through gamified social features.

Platform and Infrastructure Choice
The chosen platform leverages a combination of specialized services:

Platform: Netlify (for frontend hosting and serverless function deployment) integrated with Supabase (for managed backend services).

Key Services: PostgreSQL Database, Authentication, Realtime capabilities (via Supabase), Edge Functions (Supabase & Netlify for custom API endpoints), Storage (Supabase).

Deployment Host and Regions: [Inference] Deployment will target global CDN for frontend and a region close to the primary user base (e.g., Mumbai, India for initial rollout) for backend services.

Repository Structure
The project will utilize a Monorepo structure.

Structure: Monorepo, managed possibly with NPM Workspaces (given Vite/React context).

Package Organization: apps/ for deployable applications (e.g., web, api), packages/ for shared code (e.g., shared-types, ui-components).

Architectural Patterns
Jamstack Architecture: Static site generation/SSG (via Vite/React) with serverless APIs (Netlify Functions/Supabase Edge) - [Rationale]: Optimal performance, scalability, and security for web applications.

Component-Based UI: Reusable React components with TypeScript - [Rationale]: Maintainability, modularity, and type safety across large codebases.

Repository Pattern: Abstract data access logic - [Rationale]: Enables easier testing, clear separation of concerns, and future database migration flexibility.

API Gateway Pattern: Unified entry point for all API calls (implied by Netlify Functions/Supabase Edge acting as proxies/gateways) - [Rationale]: Centralized authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring.

Event-Driven Communication: Utilizing Supabase Realtime for selective real-time updates - [Rationale]: Supports efficient broadcasting of social and business activities to connected clients.

Microservice/Serverless Functions (Conceptual): Distinct serverless functions for specific business logic (e.g., Coupon generation, Driver calculation) - [Rationale]: Promotes independent deployment, scalability, and modularity.
