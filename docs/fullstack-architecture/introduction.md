# Introduction
This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for SynC, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

Starter Template or Existing Project
This is a Greenfield project. The architecture design proceeds from scratch, utilizing a combination of modern tools and frameworks rather than a single starter template. Core components like React/Vite for frontend, Supabase for backend services, and Netlify for deployment are integrated.
