# Frontend Architecture
Component Architecture Overview
The frontend architecture will be component-based using React, organized for reusability and maintainability. Components will adhere to clear responsibilities and follow atomic design principles where applicable.

Component List
Frontend Application (web app):

Responsibility: User Interface, user interaction, API consumption.

Key Interfaces: Renders UI components, makes HTTP requests to Backend API.

Dependencies: Shared UI components, shared types, Backend API.

Technology Stack: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI.

Auth Module: Manages login, signup, password reset components.

Dashboard Modules: Components for user and business dashboards, including sections for offers, activities, analytics.

Listing Components: Reusable components for displaying lists of businesses, coupons, products (e.g., cards, carousels).

Form Components: Standardized components for user input (e.g., profile forms, coupon creation forms).

Navigation Components: Headers, sidebars, footers, search bars.

Shared UI Components (packages/ui - Conceptual): Centralized library of reusable UI components built with Shadcn UI for consistency.

State Management
Approach: React Context API / Zustand / Jotai. A combination may be used based on the scope and complexity of the state. Global state for user session and key configurations, local state for form inputs and component-specific data.

Rationale: Provides efficient state management solutions that scale from simple to complex application needs.

API Integration
Approach: Frontend services will be responsible for consuming backend APIs. These services will handle data fetching, error handling, and data transformation before passing to UI components.

Client Configuration: Use a modern HTTP client (e.g., fetch API, Axios) configured with authentication interceptors for JWT.

Routing
Approach: Client-side routing using React Router (or similar) to manage navigation between pages.

Structure: Defined routes for authenticated and unauthenticated users/businesses, including protected routes that require user authentication.

Styling Guidelines
Approach: Utility-first CSS framework (Tailwind CSS) for rapid and consistent styling. Shadcn UI components will be customized using Tailwind.

Global Theme: globals.css will include base Tailwind directives and any custom CSS variables for branding colors, typography, and spacing.

Testing Requirements
Approach: Full Testing Pyramid as defined in Technical Assumptions.

Frontend Specific: Unit tests for individual components (Jest/React Testing Library), Integration tests for component interactions, E2E tests for critical user flows (Playwright/Cypress).
