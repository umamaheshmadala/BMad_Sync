# Deployment Architecture
Deployment Strategy
Frontend Deployment: Frontend application will be deployed as a Single Page Application (SPA) or Static Site Generation (SSG) via Netlify, leveraging its global CDN for low latency.

Backend Deployment: Serverless functions will be deployed via Netlify Functions or Supabase Edge Functions, offering auto-scaling and pay-per-use billing.

Database: Supabase manages the PostgreSQL database, handling scaling, backups, and replication.

Deployment Frequency: Continuous Delivery - multiple times a day. Changes will be deployed upon successful CI/CD pipeline runs to ensure rapid iteration and continuous integration.

CI/CD Pipeline
A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) will automate build, test, and deployment processes.
