# Security and Performance
Security Requirements
Frontend Security:

CSP Headers: Implement Content Security Policy headers to mitigate XSS attacks.

XSS Prevention: Ensure all user-generated content is properly escaped before rendering.

Secure Storage: Use browser's secure storage mechanisms (e.g., HttpOnly cookies for session tokens) for sensitive client-side data.

Backend Security:

Input Validation: Strict validation on all API inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS).

Rate Limiting: Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks.

CORS Policy: Properly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies.

HTTPS Enforcement: All communications over HTTPS.

Authentication Security:

Token Storage: Secure storage for JWTs (e.g., HttpOnly cookies).

Session Management: Secure session management (handled by Supabase Auth).

Password Policy: Enforce strong password policies (min length, complexity).

Performance Optimization
Frontend Performance:

Bundle Size Target: Aim for optimized bundle sizes through code splitting and lazy loading.

Loading Strategy: Implement lazy loading for routes and components.

Caching Strategy: Utilize browser caching for static assets (e.g., images, CSS, JS) and CDN caching.

Backend Performance:

Response Time Target: API response times typically < 100ms for critical operations.

Database Optimization: Indexing, query optimization, connection pooling (managed by Supabase).

Caching Strategy: Implement data caching layers (e.g., Redis for frequently accessed data) in serverless functions where appropriate.
