# Critical User Paths & Edge Case Considerations
First-time User Onboarding & First Coupon Collection:

Path: Sign Up -> Profile Setup -> City/Interests -> Dashboard Load -> Coupon Discovery -> Collect Coupon -> Coupon in Wallet.

Edge Cases:

Empty Coupon Wallet: Display a clear message ("Your wallet is empty! Start collecting amazing deals from hyperlocal businesses.") and a "Discover Coupons" button.

No search results: Display "No results found. Try a different search." or "No hyperlocal businesses found in this area. Expand your search."

Coupon Redemption & Auto Check-in:

Path: Open Coupon Wallet -> Select Coupon -> Present for Redemption -> System confirms Redemption & Auto Check-in -> User receives confirmation -> Redirect to Business Storefront with Review Option.

Edge Cases:

Invalid Coupon: "Invalid or Expired Coupon."

Already Redeemed: "This coupon has already been redeemed."

Network Error: "An error occurred. Please try again."

User-Facing Error Strategy:

Presentation: Consistent use of Toast notifications (non-critical), Alert banners (persistent warnings), Inline messages (form validation), or Full-page errors (critical failures).

Clarity & Helpfulness: Messages will be clear, concise, and guide the user on what went wrong, why (if understandable), and how to fix it.

Consistency: Consistent visual style (e.g., red for errors, amber for warnings) and linguistic tone.

Actionability: Provide clear calls to action (e.g., "Retry," "Contact Support," "Go to Home").
