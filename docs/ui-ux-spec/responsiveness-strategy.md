# Responsiveness Strategy
Breakpoints
SynC will be designed with a responsive approach, adapting to various screen sizes. Key breakpoints will be defined for:

Mobile: (e.g., 320px - 767px)

Tablet: (e.g., 768px - 1023px)

Desktop: (e.g., 1024px and up)

Adaptation Patterns
Layout Changes: Content re-stacking, fluid grids, flexible imagery.

Navigation Changes: Hamburger menus for mobile, persistent navigation for desktop.

Content Priority: Prioritizing essential information on smaller screens.

Interaction Changes: Touch-friendly targets for mobile, hover states for desktop.
