# Performance Considerations
UI/UX design decisions will actively consider performance goals.

Page Load: Main screens load in less than 2 seconds.

Interaction Response: UI interactions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) should provide immediate feedback (e.g., loading states, disabled buttons).

Animation FPS: Animations should run smoothly at a consistent frame rate (e.g., 60 FPS).
