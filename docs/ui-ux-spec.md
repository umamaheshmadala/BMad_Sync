## Information Architecture (IA)
Site Map / Screen Inventory
The overall structure of the SynC application is organized around key user and business functions:

Code snippet

    A1 --> B(User Dashboard)
    A1 --> C(Business Dashboard)

    B --> B1(Hyperlocal Businesses Explore)
    B --> B2(Coupon Wallet)
    B --> B3(Friends & Activity Feed)
    B --> B4(Wishlist & Favorites)
    B --> B5(User Profile Management)
    B --> B6(Notifications Center)

    D[Platform Owner Dashboard] --> D1(Revenue Tracking)
    D --> D2(Business Management)
    D --> D3(Pricing Configuration)

    B --- D(Platform Owner Dashboard)
    C --- D
Navigation Structure
Primary Navigation: Prominent global navigation on both User and Business Dashboards, providing access to core sections (e.g., Explore, Wallet, Friends, Storefront Management, Analytics).

Secondary Navigation: Contextual navigation within major sections (e.g., filters within Coupon Wallet, sub-sections within Analytics Dashboard).

Breadcrumb Strategy: A subtle breadcrumb navigation will be used for deeper pages (e.g., within a business storefront or a specific analytics report) to indicate the user's current location within the hierarchy.

## User Flows
For critical user tasks, the system will provide clear, intuitive flows, addressing success paths, decision points, and error states.

User Authentication & Onboarding Flow
User Goal: Successfully sign up, log in, and complete initial profile setup to access the personalized dashboard.

Entry Points: SynC Homepage ("Sign Up" / "Login" buttons), Marketing Campaign redirects.

Success Criteria: User lands on a fully personalized and functional dashboard.

## Critical User Paths & Edge Case Considerations
First-time User Onboarding & First Coupon Collection:

Path: Sign Up -> Profile Setup -> City/Interests -> Dashboard Load -> Coupon Discovery -> Collect Coupon -> Coupon in Wallet.

Edge Cases:

Empty Coupon Wallet: Display a clear message ("Your wallet is empty! Start collecting amazing deals from hyperlocal businesses.") and a "Discover Coupons" button.

No search results: Display "No results found. Try a different search." or "No hyperlocal businesses found in this area. Expand your search."

Coupon Redemption & Auto Check-in:

Path: Open Coupon Wallet -> Select Coupon -> Present for Redemption -> System confirms Redemption & Auto Check-in -> User receives confirmation -> Redirect to Business Storefront with Review Option.

Edge Cases:

Invalid Coupon: "Invalid or Expired Coupon."

Already Redeemed: "This coupon has already been redeemed."

Network Error: "An error occurred. Please try again."

User-Facing Error Strategy:

Presentation: Consistent use of Toast notifications (non-critical), Alert banners (persistent warnings), Inline messages (form validation), or Full-page errors (critical failures).

Clarity & Helpfulness: Messages will be clear, concise, and guide the user on what went wrong, why (if understandable), and how to fix it.

Consistency: Consistent visual style (e.g., red for errors, amber for warnings) and linguistic tone.

Actionability: Provide clear calls to action (e.g., "Retry," "Contact Support," "Go to Home").

## Wireframes & Mockups
Detailed visual designs will be created in an external design tool (e.g., Figma, Sketch). This section will link to the primary design files.

Key Screen Layouts
Conceptual layouts for critical screens will prioritize mobile-first design, followed by tablet and desktop adaptations. Each layout will focus on:

Purpose: Clear objective of the screen.

Key Elements: Essential UI components.

Interaction Notes: Primary user interactions.

Design File Reference: Direct link to the specific frame in the external design tool.

## Component Library / Design System
SynC will leverage Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components. This approach will ensure a consistent and efficient development process for UI components.

Core Components
Buttons: Various states (default, hover, active, disabled, loading).

Input Fields: Text, number, password, email, with validation states (default, error, success).

Navigation Elements: Tabs, sidebars, headers, footers.

Cards: For displaying businesses, coupons, products.

Notifications/Toasts: For system feedback.

Modals/Dialogs: For confirmations, detailed forms.

Avatars & Icons: For user profiles and visual cues.

## Branding & Style Guide
Visual Identity
The branding will ensure a consistent color scheme, referencing constants/Colors.ts. The visual design will maintain a modern aesthetic, aligning with the platform's user-friendly and engaging nature.

Color Palette
A predefined color palette will be used, including primary, secondary, accent, success, warning, and error colors, alongside a range of neutral tones for text and backgrounds.

Typography
A consistent typography scale will be defined for headings (H1-H6), body text, and smaller text, ensuring readability and visual hierarchy.

Iconography
A unified icon set will be used, ensuring visual consistency across all UI elements.

Spacing & Layout
A consistent spacing scale and grid system will be implemented to ensure balanced and responsive layouts across different screen sizes.

## Accessibility Requirements
Accessibility: Visual Standards
The user interface will be designed to be visually appealing and usable by a broad range of people. Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA standards is an aspiration, to be pursued if it does not impact budget or time constraints.

## Responsiveness Strategy
Breakpoints
SynC will be designed with a responsive approach, adapting to various screen sizes. Key breakpoints will be defined for:

Mobile: (e.g., 320px - 767px)

Tablet: (e.g., 768px - 1023px)

Desktop: (e.g., 1024px and up)

Adaptation Patterns
Layout Changes: Content re-stacking, fluid grids, flexible imagery.

Navigation Changes: Hamburger menus for mobile, persistent navigation for desktop.

Content Priority: Prioritizing essential information on smaller screens.

Interaction Changes: Touch-friendly targets for mobile, hover states for desktop.

## Animation & Micro-interactions
Subtle animations and micro-interactions will be incorporated to enhance user engagement and provide delightful feedback. These will prioritize performance and accessibility. Examples include:

Button click feedback.

Loading animations.

Toast notification transitions.

Coupon collection confirmation effects.

## Performance Considerations
UI/UX design decisions will actively consider performance goals.

Page Load: Main screens load in less than 2 seconds.

Interaction Response: UI interactions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) should provide immediate feedback (e.g., loading states, disabled buttons).

Animation FPS: Animations should run smoothly at a consistent frame rate (e.g., 60 FPS).

## Next Steps
After completing the UI/UX specification:

Stakeholder Review: Recommend review with key stakeholders (e.g., Product Owner, Architect) to ensure alignment.

Visual Design Creation: Proceed to create detailed visual designs (wireframes, mockups, prototypes) in an external design tool.

Handoff to Architect: Prepare for handoff to the Architect for Frontend Architecture design.

Open Questions: Note any open questions or decisions that emerge during the design process.

## Checklist Results
[This section will be populated after the UI/UX Specification is reviewed against a dedicated UI/UX checklist.]
