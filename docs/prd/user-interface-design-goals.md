# User Interface Design Goals
Overall UX Vision
The overall UX vision for SynC is to provide an extremely modern, user-friendly, and engaging interface. It aims to be a single-window channel for users to seamlessly explore businesses, manage social interactions, share gamified coupons, and receive incentives. The design will prioritize clarity and ease of use to connect users with brick-and-mortar stores and enable businesses to reach their target audience effectively. All UI components will strive for a modern look, following industry best practices.

Key Interaction Paradigms
SynC's key interaction paradigms will revolve around real-time updates for social and business activity, allowing users to choose interests that matter to them for focused content delivery.
