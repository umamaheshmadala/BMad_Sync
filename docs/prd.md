SynC Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Executive Summary
SynC is a user-friendly web application designed to connect users with Hyperlocal businesses, facilitate social interactions, and enable gamified coupon sharing and incentives. It aims to bridge the gap faced by physical stores in instantly reaching customers with updates and staying connected during non-shopping times, a challenge e-commerce businesses have overcome. The product will enhance user engagement by offering a single channel for business exploration and digital coupon management, while providing businesses with a targeted, cost-effective marketing approach for customer acquisition and retention.

## Problem Statement
Brick-and-mortar businesses struggle to instantly update customers on offerings and stay connected during non-shopping times, leading to reduced footfall despite the "feel the product" value proposition. This puts them at a disadvantage compared to e-commerce businesses that excel at instant customer updates, offers, and promotions. SynC aims to solve this by providing a unified platform for discovery, engagement, and rewards, leveraging social features to drive organic growth and retention for businesses.

## Proposed Solution
SynC bridges the gap between businesses and users by providing a unified platform for discovery, engagement, and rewards, leveraging social features and for businesses to drive organic growth and retention. It will offer a single window for users to explore businesses, stay updated on promotions, and manage digital coupons. For businesses, it provides a new channel for bullseye marketing, customer acquisition, and enhanced Customer Lifetime Value. Gamified coupon sharing and digital storefronts are key components of this solution.

## Goals and Background Context
Goals
Increase user engagement with Hyperlocal stores in cities: SynC aims to achieve this by providing users with a single window channel to explore Hyperlocal businesses, stay updated on their offerings and promotions, and collect and store digital coupons, thereby enhancing footfall to physical stores.

Enhance businesses’ marketing approach: By offering businesses a new digital channel to broaden their target area, penetration, and demographics through bullseye marketing with minimal expenditure.

Minimize Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) for businesses: This is achieved by enabling businesses to participate in gamified coupon sharing, coupon redemption, and targeted promotions.

Increase Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) for businesses: SynC helps businesses maintain up-to-date digital storefronts, allowing loyal customers and followers to stay informed on what business offers, thus fostering continued engagement.

Generate revenue: SynC will monetize through various streams including a cost per coupon generated (₹2/coupon), a daily charge for promotional banners (₹500/banner/day), and a daily fee for first place in search results (₹500/day).

Background Context
E-commerce businesses thrive by instantly updating customers with offers, coupons, and promotions. In contrast, "Hyperlocal" businesses, despite offering the value proposition of experiencing a physical product, are experiencing a drop in footfall due to their inability to instantly reach customers with updates and maintain continuous connection during non-shopping times.

SynC directly addresses this critical gap by providing a unified platform for discovery, engagement, and rewards, leveraging social features to drive organic growth and retention for businesses. For users, it offers a single channel to explore businesses, stay updated on offerings and promotions, and collect digital coupons. Users can specify their interests to receive only relevant updates, ensuring a focused and personalized experience.

For businesses, SynC offers a new channel for "bullseye marketing," allowing them to broaden their target reach and demographics with minimal expenditure. Businesses participate in gamified coupon sharing and redemption, which helps to minimize their Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC). The platform gamifies customer interactions, solving the challenge of "staying connected with customers" and "marketing budget minimization" by replacing traditional influencers and cold marketing techniques. A key gamification element is the identification of "Drivers" – the top 10% of active users in a city, determined by metrics such as coupon collections, sharing coupons, business check-ins (GPS-based or coupon redemption triggered), writing reviews, recommending businesses, and interacting with ads and top products in storefronts. All these activities carry equal weight in determining "Driver" status, though the Platform Owner can adjust these weightages dynamically. Businesses are encouraged to attract these "Drivers" by offering them exclusive benefits, aiming to increase footfall, visibility, and revenue.

User Research & Problem Validation Methodology
The problem statement and user needs identified for SynC are informed by a structured research methodology combining primary qualitative and quantitative approaches.

Primary Research Methods Used:

## User Interface Design Goals
Overall UX Vision
The overall UX vision for SynC is to provide an extremely modern, user-friendly, and engaging interface. It aims to be a single-window channel for users to seamlessly explore businesses, manage social interactions, share gamified coupons, and receive incentives. The design will prioritize clarity and ease of use to connect users with brick-and-mortar stores and enable businesses to reach their target audience effectively. All UI components will strive for a modern look, following industry best practices.

Key Interaction Paradigms
SynC's key interaction paradigms will revolve around real-time updates for social and business activity, allowing users to choose interests that matter to them for focused content delivery. The platform will facilitate intuitive navigation for coupon discovery, collection, sharing, and in-store redemption. Social interactions will enable finding friends, managing requests, and viewing activity feeds with a clear emphasis on gamified coupon sharing.

Core Screens and Views
The most critical screens or views necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals include:

User Dashboard

Business Storefronts

Coupon Wallet

Friend Profiles & Activity Feed

Wishlist & Favorites

Feedback/Review Submission

User Profile Management

Business Profile Management

Platform Owner Dashboard

Login/Signup Screens

Accessibility: Visual Standards
The user interface will be designed to be visually appealing and usable by a broad range of people. Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA standards is an aspiration, to be pursued if it does not impact budget or time constraints.

Branding
The branding will ensure a consistent color scheme, referencing constants/Colors.ts. The visual design will maintain a modern aesthetic, aligning with the platform's user-friendly and engaging nature.

Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
SynC will primarily target web users with a responsive web application, ensuring a seamless experience across various screen sizes and devices. The core technologies for this will be React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Technical Assumptions
This section gathers the high-level technical decisions and preferences that will guide the Architect in designing SynC's system. These assumptions, once confirmed, will serve as critical constraints and foundational choices for all subsequent technical work.

Repository Structure: Monorepo
Given the full-stack nature of SynC (React/Vite frontend, Supabase/Netlify serverless backend), a Monorepo structure is recommended.

Rationale: This approach facilitates shared code (e.g., TypeScript types, utility functions) between frontend and backend, simplifies dependency management, and can streamline CI/CD pipelines, which is beneficial for a project aiming for rapid development and consistency across layers.

Trade-offs: While offering benefits for shared code and unified pipelines, monorepos can introduce complexity in managing dependencies for very large teams or across vastly different technology stacks.

Service Architecture: Serverless
SynC's backend explicitly leverages Serverless functions using Supabase Edge Functions and Netlify for custom API endpoints.

Rationale: This aligns with the non-functional requirements for scalability (support for 10,000+ concurrent users), cost-effectiveness, and automatic scaling without managing traditional servers. Supabase provides managed PostgreSQL, Auth, and Storage, complementing the serverless compute model.

Trade-offs: Serverless offers significant scalability and reduced operational overhead but can introduce challenges like 'cold starts' (initial latency for infrequently used functions) and potential vendor lock-in for specific features.

Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid
To meet the reliability goal of 99.9% uptime and ensure robust functionality, a Full Testing Pyramid approach is assumed.

Rationale: This includes:

Unit Tests: For individual components and functions (both frontend and backend).

Integration Tests: To verify interactions between modules and services (e.g., frontend API calls to backend, backend interacting with Supabase).

End-to-End (E2E) Tests: To validate critical user flows across the entire application, ensuring the system works as a whole.
This comprehensive strategy ensures high code quality, reduces bugs, and supports the goal of no assumptions in subsequent development by AI agents.

Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
Frontend Framework: React with Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimal performance.

UI Component Library/Styling: Tailwind CSS and Shadcn for consistent, modern, and accessible UI development.

Backend Database: PostgreSQL, managed via Supabase, for relational data storage.

Authentication: Supabase Auth for user and business authentication.

Deployment: Netlify for frontend hosting and serverless function deployment.

Dependency Management Note: While not anticipated in this greenfield setup, any future specific library versions or unusual configurations that might cause conflicts or require special handling (e.g., polyfills, environment-specific configurations) should be explicitly documented.

Areas Requiring Deeper Architectural Investigation & Technical Risks
This section explicitly flags areas that may require more detailed design, pose significant technical risks, or need specific mitigation strategies beyond the high-level assumptions.

Real-time Updates for High Concurrency: The requirement for "Real-time updates for social and business activity" (NFR2) for "10,000+ concurrent users" (NFR5) will require careful architectural design around WebSocket implementation, pub/sub patterns, and backend message queues (e.g., using Supabase Realtime or a dedicated service) to handle load efficiently.

Gamification Algorithm Backend Complexity: The "Driver" status calculation (FR59), involving multiple weighted metrics and dynamic weightage changes, will need a robust and efficient backend implementation to avoid performance bottlenecks and ensure data consistency.

Multi-level Categorization Accuracy: The automated categorization of Wishlist items (Story 2.6) and business products (Story 2.2) will require a precise and scalable mechanism to ensure accuracy for matching and targeting. Initial design will define the categorization rules, but refinement may require ML/AI investigation post-MVP.

Coupon Lifecycle State Management: The complex coupon lifecycle (creation, sharing, acceptance, decline, redemption, expiry, cancellation by sender) (Story 3.5, 3.6) requires meticulous state management and transaction integrity in the backend to prevent fraud and ensure accurate tracking.

Internal Documentation Requirements
To ensure consistency and clarity for all developers (human and AI agents), the following internal documentation standards are required:

Code Documentation: All functions, components, and modules shall include comprehensive inline documentation (e.g., JSDoc/TSDoc for TypeScript code) describing their purpose, parameters, return values, and any side effects.

API Documentation: All API endpoints (both REST and serverless functions) shall be documented using an OpenAPI/Swagger specification (or similar tool for tRPC/GraphQL if adopted later). This documentation should define methods, paths, request/response schemas, and authentication requirements.

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs): Key architectural decisions and their rationale shall be formally documented as Architectural Decision Records (ADRs). Each ADR will capture the decision, context, alternatives considered, and consequences.

Technical Specifications: For complex features or modules, supplementary technical specification documents (e.g., detailing data flows, state machines, or complex algorithms) shall be created.

## Epic List
Epic 1: Foundational Platform & Core User/Business Onboarding

Goal: Establish the core application infrastructure, secure user and business authentication, and enable basic profile management for both user types to allow initial engagement.

Epic 2: Digital Storefronts & Basic Discovery
